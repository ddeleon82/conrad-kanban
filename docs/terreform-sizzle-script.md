# Terreform ONE — Sizzle Reel Script

**Duration:** 1:45 - 2:00  
**Tone:** Awe-inspiring, hopeful, visionary  
**Theme:** "What If" — imagination meets technology at the service of life  
**Client:** Terreform ONE (nonprofit architecture + urban design)

---

## CONCEPT

Counter the dystopian narrative. Every sci-fi film, every warning about the future — they all show decay, scarcity, collapse. But what if the future could be *alive*? What if buildings could breathe, grow, heal? What if cities could be forests? What if architecture could fight extinction instead of causing it?

Terreform ONE is building that future. Right now.

## SCRIPT (V.O.)

**[OPEN: BLACK]**

*[Sound: Distant thunder, wind — ominous]*

**V.O.:**
"We've been told what the future looks like."

**[CUT TO: Dystopian imagery — crumbling cities, pollution, drought]**

*[Sound: Industrial noise, tension]*

**V.O.:**
"Choking skies. Dying oceans. Cities of glass and steel and silence."

**[BEAT — silence]**

**V.O.:**
"But what if they were wrong?"

**[CUT TO: Light breaking through — a seedling pushing through concrete]**

*[Sound: Shift — organic, hopeful, growing]*

**V.O.:**
"What if buildings could grow?"

**[CUT TO: Fab Tree Hab — living tree structure, willow canopy, organic scaffolding]**

**V.O.:**
"What if walls could breathe... and shelter wasn't built, but *planted*?"

**[CUT TO: Cricket Shelter — modular pods, life cycle imagery, community farming]**

**V.O.:**
"What if food came not from factories... but from architecture itself?"

**[CUT TO: Monarch Sanctuary — butterflies against glass, vertical meadow, living façade]**

**V.O.:**
"What if a single building could bring a species back from the edge?"

*[Sound: Swelling — wonder]*

**[CUT TO: Venice Biennale — kelp reef, bioluminescent installation, DNA visualization]**

**V.O.:**
"What if libraries weren't built of stone... but *grown* from living memory?"

**[MONTAGE: Quick cuts — organic structures, butterflies, crickets, willow trees grafting, children touching living walls]**

**V.O.:**
"This isn't science fiction. This is science. This is design. This is happening."

**[CUT TO: Wide shot — Fab Tree Hab at dawn, mist rising, life stirring]**

*[Sound: Quiet — birdsong, wind through leaves]*

**V.O.:**
"Terreform ONE doesn't design buildings. They design against extinction."

**[CUT TO: Close-up — hands grafting a branch, sunlight through leaves]**

**V.O.:**
"They don't ask what we can take from nature..."

**[CUT TO: Monarch butterfly landing on milkweed]**

**V.O.:**
"...they ask what we can give back."

**[BLACK]**

*[Sound: Single heartbeat — or breath]*

**V.O.:**
"The future isn't coming."

**[CUT TO: Final image — child looking up at the Fab Tree Hab, wonder on their face]**

**V.O.:**
"It's growing."

## MUSIC DIRECTION

**Style:** Evolving — dark ambient → organic growth → hopeful crescendo → quiet resolution

**References:**
- Jóhann Jóhannsson (Arrival) — for the wonder
- Max Richter — for the emotional arc
- Ólafur Arnalds — for organic electronic textures

**Key moments:**
- 0:15 — the turn (silence, then new theme emerges)
- 1:10 — montage acceleration
- 1:40 — drop to quiet, single instrument

## PRODUCTION NOTES

1. **Actual footage needed:** Terreform should have B-roll of their projects. Request access.
2. **Stock considerations:** Mix actual project footage with evocative nature/architecture stock.
3. **Animation potential:** DNA sequences, building "growing" time-lapse simulations.
4. **VO casting:** Warm, thoughtful, not preachy. Think David Attenborough meets Spike Jonze narrator.
