# 10 Ways Conrad Can Help Dom

*Based on Dom's interests, business context, and goals as of January 2026*

---

## Context Summary

- **Business:** Freedom & Coffee — audience intelligence agency with flagship offer IntentOS
- **Goal:** Scale to consistent $10K+ months, eventually take financial pressure off Danai
- **Exit Plan:** Leave US by June 2025 (pending business scaling)
- **Personal:** 6'5" southpaw boxer training for May 2026 amateur fight, needs to drop to ~260 lbs
- **Family:** Wife Danai (VP at Sunshine Sachs), 6yo daughter, 2mo son Asa
- **Current Clients:** P&G/Mielle via Egami, Theme Health, The Refig, Living Leadership

---

## 1. **Daily Business Operations Autopilot**
*Immediate impact — saves 1-2 hours daily*

- **Morning brief:** Weather, calendar, urgent emails, overnight notifications
- **Email triage:** Flag important client emails, draft responses for review
- **Meeting prep:** Pull relevant context before calls (client history, last touchpoints)
- **Follow-up tracking:** Ensure no client conversation falls through the cracks

**Why it matters:** You're spread thin. I can be your always-on ops layer.

---

## 2. **IntentOS Delivery Acceleration**
*Revenue impact — faster delivery = more capacity = more clients*

- **Research automation:** Run initial audience intelligence gathering before you do deep analysis
- **Report templating:** Generate first-draft IntentOS reports that you refine
- **Competitive intel:** Monitor competitors of your clients' brands
- **Data collection:** Pull social listening data, trend analysis, sentiment

**Why it matters:** If IntentOS takes 48 hours, can I cut the grunt work to help you do 2x the volume?

---

## 3. **Client Dashboard & Reporting**
*Professional polish — clients see value visually*

- **Automated reporting:** Daily/weekly stats compiled without manual work
- **Interactive dashboards:** Live campaign performance (the product doc is in progress)
- **Presentation prep:** Generate slide decks for client calls

**Why it matters:** Clients who *see* their ROI stay longer and pay more.

---

## 4. **Content Creation & Social Presence**
*Marketing leverage — your voice amplified*

- **Newsletter drafts:** Write first drafts of F&C newsletters for your review
- **LinkedIn content:** Draft thought leadership posts about audience intelligence
- **Twitter/X engagement:** Monitor mentions, draft replies, surface conversations to join
- **Case study writing:** Document client wins for marketing materials

**Why it matters:** You know the content game. I can do the production; you do the curation.

---

## 5. **Lead Gen & Sales Pipeline**
*Growth engine — consistent inbound*

- **Prospect research:** Identify companies that fit your ICP (brands needing audience intelligence)
- **Outreach drafts:** Personalized cold emails based on research
- **CRM maintenance:** Keep your pipeline data clean and up-to-date
- **Follow-up sequences:** Ensure no lead goes cold without a touchpoint

**Why it matters:** Consistent $10K months require consistent pipeline, not feast/famine.

---

## 6. **Boxing & Fitness Accountability**
*Personal — the fight is 16 months away*

- **Training schedule:** Track your 5x/week boxing at Lobos
- **Nutrition nudges:** Flag when you're likely under-eating (you mentioned this is an issue)
- **Weight tracking:** Log and visualize progress toward 260 lbs
- **Recovery reminders:** Rest days, hydration, sleep

**Why it matters:** You can't build a business if you're burnt out. The fight gives you a deadline for peak performance.

---

## 7. **Family Logistics Support**
*Quality of life — more present with less mental overhead*

- **Calendar coordination:** Danai's schedule + your schedule = fewer conflicts
- **Kid stuff:** Reminders for school events, activities, appointments
- **Travel planning:** When the US exit happens, I can research logistics
- **Gift/occasion reminders:** Birthdays, anniversaries, don't miss them

**Why it matters:** Danai is carrying the financial weight. You carrying the mental load at home is a fair trade.

---

## 8. **Financial Tracking & Forecasting**
*Clarity — know your numbers*

- **Revenue tracking:** Log payments, project monthly run rate
- **Expense monitoring:** Flag subscriptions to cancel (you're cutting Manus, GenSpark, OpenAI)
- **Runway calculation:** How long until you need to hit specific revenue targets?
- **Invoice reminders:** Chase late payments

**Why it matters:** You mentioned this month is ~$20K. Let's make that predictable, not a surprise.

---

## 9. **Learning & Skill Development**
*Long-term leverage — you're a strategist, stay sharp*

- **Curated reading:** Surface articles, podcasts, videos relevant to your work
- **Summarize content:** TL;DR on long-form stuff so you can decide what's worth deep-diving
- **Trend monitoring:** AI, marketing, culture shifts that affect your clients
- **Book notes:** If you're reading something, I can pull key insights for reference

**Why it matters:** Your competitive advantage is insight. Feed the machine.

---

## 10. **Second Brain & Knowledge Management**
*Infrastructure — everything in one place*

- **Notion organization:** Once I have access, structure your agency dashboard
- **Meeting notes:** Transcribe, summarize, extract action items
- **Idea capture:** When you voice-note a thought, I log it properly
- **Decision log:** Record why you made choices so future-you remembers

**Why it matters:** You're building something. Document it so it scales beyond your head.

## What's Next?

Pick 2-3 of these to start. I'll set up the systems and we iterate.

The goal: **every week, you should feel like you have more hours than the week before.**
