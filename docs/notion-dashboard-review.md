## Overview

The F+C Agency Kit Dashboard is a comprehensive Notion workspace with interconnected databases for managing clients, projects, and tasks. Overall structure is solid — here's what I found.

## Observations & Recommendations

### 🟢 Strengths
1. **Good relational structure** — Projects linked to Companies, Tasks linked to Projects
2. **Clear status tracking** — Status fields with color-coded options
3. **Value tracking** — Though underutilized (only 4 projects have $ values)
4. **Health indicator** — Project health field exists (Green/Yellow/Red) but not populated

### 🟡 Opportunities
1. **Task debt** — 20+ tasks "On Hold" dating back to 2024-2025. Recommend archiving stale ones.
2. **Overdue tasks** — Several tasks past due dates. Either update dates or complete/archive.
3. **Missing values** — Most projects don't have Value filled in. This would help track revenue.
4. **Health field unused** — Project Health (Green/Yellow/Red) not being used. Could be valuable for quick dashboard views.
5. **Follow-ups pending** — 8 clients in "Follow Up Required" status — potential revenue sitting.

### 🔴 Action Items
1. **Archive or update stale tasks** — Anything On Hold for 6+ months
2. **Populate project values** — Even estimates help track pipeline
3. **Follow up on warm leads:**
   - Seeme Index
   - RALLY
   - Narrative Partners
   - Natasha Pineiro
   - Sana Afzal
   - OEFFA
4. **Revive "In Conversation" clients:**
   - Terreform (you already have a project)
   - Harmony Labs
   - Greater NY
   - Civilco

## What I Can Help With

Now that I have Notion access, I can:
- **Create tasks** from our conversations automatically
- **Update project statuses** as work progresses
- **Track follow-ups** and remind you when clients need attention
- **Generate reports** (pipeline value, task completion, etc.)
- **Keep project notes** synced with our work

Want me to start cleaning up the stale tasks, or should we tackle the follow-up clients first?
